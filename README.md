## Summary

The Classic Arcade game is based on the older game called Frogger. The object is to get across the game board without getting hit. If a collision is detected the player will be sent to the beginning and have to start over.

## instructions

Use the arrows on your keyboard to navigate left and right and to move forward or backwards. If hit you will have to start over. Once you make it across you will have won the game and will have the option to play again.
